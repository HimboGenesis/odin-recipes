# odin-recipes
<!--- This is my recipe website. I guess I could 
steadily add to this in the event of a cataclysmic internet
blackout and only local networks remain intact. 
 
I am also encouraged to discuss the skills I am developing alongside this website; the main skills involve git workflow, basic html text formatting, linking pages through relative and/or absolute directories, and possibly a few others that I will pick back up as I progress.

 Today I brushed up on the different tags such as the hyperreference and image embedding tags. I have not tried opening my two recipes in a web browser yet, and when I do, I will see how well I remembered the ordered and unordered list tags. I expect to fiddle with it a bit until it looks the way it's supposed to. I also reviewed some of the directory manipulation commands in the terminal. 

 Another odd issue that is not unique to my experience is this README.md markdown file is not getting staged by git for some reason. I will have to investigate further
